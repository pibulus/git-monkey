# Git Monkey Status Report

## Overview

Git Monkey is a CLI tool that makes Git more accessible through a friendly, guided interface. It combines practical Git functionality with educational elements and an enjoyable UX, following its "Soft Stack" design philosophy of emotional intelligence, delightful UX, slack for chaos, and balancing hacker joy with human ease.

## Core Architecture

The application is built with a modular bash script architecture:

- **Entry Points**: `/bin/git-monkey` and `/gitmonkey.sh` serve as the main CLI routers
- **Command Modules**: Individual functionality in `/commands/` directory
- **Utility Libraries**: Shared functions in `/utils/` directory
- **Assets**: ASCII art and messages in `/assets/` directory
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs in `/docs/` directory

## Key Design Systems

Git Monkey implements several sophisticated design systems:

1. **Tone Stage System (0-5)**: Adapts language and detail based on user experience level
   - Stage 0-1: Beginners (detailed, friendly explanations)
   - Stage 2-3: Intermediate (moderate detail, some technical terminology)
   - Stage 4-5: Advanced (minimal, technical explanations)

2. **Theme System**: Personalized UX with different visual styles and language
   - Jungle: Playful, nature-themed (monkeys, bananas)
   - Hacker: Technical, matrix-style (code references)
   - Wizard: Magical, mystical (spell-casting)
   - Cosmic: Space-themed (celestial metaphors)

3. **Identity System**: Personalized interactions combining names and titles
   - Real names or anonymized alternatives
   - Earned titles based on activity and tone stage

4. **Visual Feedback System**: Terminal-based visual elements
   - ASCII art for complex concepts
   - Typewriter effects
   - Progress visualization
   - Performance comparison metrics
