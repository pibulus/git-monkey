PUSH: Publishing Local Commits to Remote Repository

USAGE:
gitmonkey push [options]

OPTIONS:
--force, -f     # Force update remote branch (use with caution)
--no-config     # Don't offer to configure autoSetupRemote
--yes, -y       # Auto-confirm all prompts

BEHAVIOR:
- Automatically sets up upstream tracking for new branches
- Offers to configure git config --global push.autoSetupRemote
- Provides helpful error messages for common push issues

TIP: For situations where branch histories have diverged but you
     want to overwrite the remote, use --force with caution.

WARNING: Force pushing rewrites remote history and can cause problems
         for collaborators who have pulled the original commits.

RELATED COMMANDS:
git push -u origin <branch>  # Manual upstream setup
git pull                     # Fetch and merge remote changes
git fetch                    # Download remote changes without merging
