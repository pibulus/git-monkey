PUSH: Sharing Your Code with Others

Pushing is how you send your commits from your computer to a shared repository
(like GitHub) so others can see and use your code.

BASIC USAGE:
gitmonkey push       # Push your current branch

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
- You must commit your changes locally before pushing
- First-time push for a new branch is handled automatically
- You need internet connection to push

TIP: Push often to avoid big conflicts with teammates' code

NOTE: If your push is rejected, you might need to pull first:
      git pull

EXAMPLES:
  gitmonkey push              # Push current branch
  gitmonkey push --force      # Force push (use carefully!)
