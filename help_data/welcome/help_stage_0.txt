WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
The `welcome` command gives you a friendly introduction to Git Monkey! It's like meeting a new friend who will help you learn to code.

BASIC USAGE:
  gitmonkey welcome

This command will:
- Show you what Git Monkey can do
- Let you pick a fun theme that matches your style
- Help you get started with your first commands
- Explain things in a way that's easy to understand

TIP: If you ever feel lost or want to see the introduction again, just type `gitmonkey welcome` and it will start over!

EXAMPLES:
  gitmonkey welcome              # Start the welcome experience from the beginning
  gitmonkey welcome --skip-intro # Skip the animations and get straight to the content

NOTE: The welcome experience automatically runs the first time you use Git Monkey, but you can run it again anytime you want a refresher!
