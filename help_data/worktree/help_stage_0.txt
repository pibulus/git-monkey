WORKTREE: Working on Multiple Things at Once

Worktrees are like having several copies of your repository that you can switch
between without stashing or committing unfinished work.

BASIC USAGE:
gitmonkey worktree:add feature-name    # Create new worktree
gitmonkey worktree:switch feature-name # Switch to that worktree

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
- Worktrees let you work on multiple branches simultaneously
- Each worktree is in its own directory but connected to your main repo
- You can have different branches open at the same time!

TIP: Worktrees are perfect for when you need to fix a bug while in the
     middle of working on a feature.

NOTE: When using worktrees, you don't need to commit or stash changes
      before switching context - each worktree keeps its own state.

EXAMPLES:
  gitmonkey worktree:add bugfix         # Create worktree for a bugfix
  gitmonkey worktree:list               # See all active worktrees
  gitmonkey worktree:remove bugfix      # Clean up when done
