COMMIT: Advanced Commit Operations

USAGE:
git commit [<options>] [--] [<pathspec>...]

KEY OPTIONS:
-a                # Auto-stage modified tracked files
-p                # Choose hunks interactively
--amend           # Amend previous commit
-S[<keyid>]       # GPG-sign commit
--fixup=<commit>  # Mark as fixup for specified commit
--squash=<commit> # Mark as squash onto specified commit
-F <file>         # Read message from file

COMMIT HOOKS:
prepare-commit-msg   # Populates default message
commit-msg           # Validates commit message format
post-commit          # Fires after commit completes

TIP: Use `git rebase -i --autosquash` after creating fixup commits
     to automatically merge them during rebase operations.

WARNING: Amending pushed commits requires force push and can disrupt
         collaborators if the commits were already shared.
