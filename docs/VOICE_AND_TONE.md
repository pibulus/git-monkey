# üêí The Git Monkey Voice & Tone Guide

## Why This Exists

This document is our north star for creating a consistent voice across Git Monkey and future projects. It's not about rigid rules; it's about capturing a vibe that makes technical tools feel alive, approachable, and slightly mischievous.

## Core Principles

### 1. Trust the Developer's Intelligence
We respect your brain. No over-explaining basic concepts. No assuming you're lost. We'll illuminate the path without holding your hand too tight.

### 2. Personality Without the Cringe 
We're a character, not a cartoon. Playful but not childish. Technical but not dry. We add flavor without forcing jokes or pandering "hey fellow kids" energy.

### 3. Context-Aware Communication
We adapt to your situation and experience level. A Git newbie gets more scaffolding, while a 10-year veteran gets straight to the point. Both feel respected.

### 4. Modularity & Flow
Our copy is built like good code: modular, reusable, and with a natural rhythm. Each piece should feel like it belongs to the greater system.

### 5. Make the Terminal Human
CLIs are traditionally cold, cryptic spaces. We bring warmth, clarity, and a splash of personality to the machine world.

## The Theme System

Git Monkey adapts its voice through four distinct theme personalities, each with its own lexical palette and tone:

### üå¥ Jungle
**Vibe**: Playful explorer, natural, organic
**Character**: A friendly monkey guide swinging through code trees
**Vocabulary**: Vines, swinging, bananas, trees, jungle paths
**Voice Example**: "üçå Swinging to a new branch! This will let you experiment without disturbing the main tree."

### üíª Hacker
**Vibe**: Technical, precise, slightly cyberpunk
**Character**: An elite system operator with command-line prowess
**Vocabulary**: System, access, scan, terminal, analyze, decrypt
**Voice Example**: "ACCESS GRANTED: Branch created. System configured for parallel development vectors."

### ‚ú® Wizard
**Vibe**: Mystical, wise, slightly mysterious
**Character**: A code sorcerer who treats Git operations as spells
**Vocabulary**: Enchant, scroll, arcane, conjure, mystical, potion
**Voice Example**: "‚ú® Branch enchantment complete! Your code is now safely stored in a parallel dimension."

### üåå Cosmic
**Vibe**: Expansive, visionary, space-themed
**Character**: A navigator of code galaxies and project universes
**Vocabulary**: Orbit, star, galaxy, cosmic, voyage, constellation
**Voice Example**: "üöÄ New branch has entered orbit! You're now exploring an alternate timeline of your codebase."

## Tone Stages

We adjust our verbosity and technical depth based on the user's experience level:

### Stage 0-1: Beginner
- Thorough explanations
- Concrete metaphors
- Step-by-step guidance
- More emoji and visual reinforcement
- Celebrates small wins

### Stage 2-3: Intermediate
- Reduced explanation length
- More technical terminology
- Fewer step-by-step instructions
- Balanced emoji usage
- Acknowledges progress implicitly

### Stage 4-5: Advanced
- Concise, direct communication
- Full technical vocabulary
- Assumes understanding of concepts
- Minimal emoji (just enough for personality)
- Treats user as a peer

## Copywriting Patterns

### Success Messages
- **Better than**: "Operation completed successfully"
- **We use**: Short, satisfying confirmations with personality
- **Examples**:
  - Jungle: "Branch created! Ready to swing through some new code? üêí"
  - Hacker: "Branch vector initialized. Status: operational."
  - Wizard: "‚ú® The branch has been conjured from the ether!"
  - Cosmic: "üå† A new celestial body has formed in your repository."

### Error Messages
- **Better than**: "Error occurred. Operation failed."
- **We use**: Clear explanations with a dash of personality and always a path forward
- **Examples**:
  - Jungle: "Oops! Got tangled in some vines. This branch already exists."
  - Hacker: "ACCESS DENIED: Cannot delete the active branch. Switch vectors first."
  - Wizard: "The spell fizzled! Your working directory contains uncommitted changes."
  - Cosmic: "Gravitational anomaly detected! Cannot merge branches with conflicts."

### Help Text
- **Better than**: "Use --force to override this behavior"
- **We use**: Context-aware explanations that teach while solving
- **Examples**:
  - Jungle: "Not sure which path to take? Try 'gitmonkey visualize' to see the jungle map."
  - Hacker: "SYSTEM TIP: Execute 'gitmonkey stash' to cache current changes before proceeding."
  - Wizard: "Consult your spellbook with 'gitmonkey help' to discover more magical incantations."
  - Cosmic: "Navigate the stars with 'gitmonkey visualize' to chart your repository's constellation."

### Menus & Options
- **Better than**: "Select option (1-5):"
- **We use**: Clear choices with theme-specific framing
- **Examples**:
  - Jungle: "Which vine do you want to swing to?"
  - Hacker: "SELECT OPERATION VECTOR:"
  - Wizard: "Choose your arcane technique:"
  - Cosmic: "Select your interstellar destination:"

## Words & Phrases to Use

### Universal Favorites
- "Let's", "We", "Together" (collaborative framing)
- "Actually", "In fact", "Specifically" (precision markers)
- "Clean", "Fresh", "Clear" (positive state descriptors)
- "Just", "Simply", "Directly" (simplicity indicators)

### Theme-Specific Go-To Words

| Jungle | Hacker | Wizard | Cosmic |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| swing | execute | enchant | navigate |
| explore | analyze | conjure | traverse |
| path | vector | spell | orbit |
| tree | system | scroll | constellation |
| branch | node | potion | galaxy |
| climb | access | arcane | stellar |
| vine | scan | magical | cosmic |
| banana | terminal | mystical | voyage |

## What We Don't Do

### No Fake Enthusiasm
- **Avoid**: "Yay! You did it! You're amazing at Git now!!!"
- **Instead**: "Branch created. You're on the right track."

### No Forced Humor
- **Avoid**: Trying to make every message funny or full of puns
- **Instead**: Natural personality with occasional wit where it fits

### No Jargon Overload
- **Avoid**: Dense technical terms without context for beginners
- **Instead**: Progressive disclosure of complexity based on user level

### No Passive Aggressive
- **Avoid**: "You might want to commit your changes first..."
- **Instead**: "Let's commit those changes before switching branches."

### No Wall of Text
- **Avoid**: Lengthy paragraphs of explanation
- **Instead**: Concise, scannable chunks with clear hierarchy

## Easter Eggs & Surprise Delight

We believe in hidden gems that reward exploration:

- Rare special messages (1 in 20 occurrences)
- Seasonal variations on certain commands
- Hidden commands or options that do unexpected things
- References to coding culture, movies, or games

## Copy Testing

When writing new copy, run it through these checks:

1. **Theme Check**: Does it sound right for the current theme?
2. **Tone Stage Check**: Is it appropriate for the user's experience level?
3. **Clarity Check**: Would a non-native English speaker understand it?
4. **Personality Check**: Does it sound like Git Monkey or just a generic tool?
5. **The Pablo Test**: Would Pablo say this out loud without cringing?

## Final Notes

This document is a living reference. Our voice evolves as our tools and users do.

Remember: We're not trying to be the zany comic relief in the developer's day. We're the trusty sidekick who makes the hard stuff easier and adds just enough personality to make the terminal feel less like talking to a machine and more like working with a slightly unusual friend.
