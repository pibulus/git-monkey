## üöÄ Getting Started

Git Monkey's AI features require an API key from one of the supported AI providers. Here's how to set up:

1. **During first-time onboarding**: When you first run Git Monkey, you'll be offered AI integration as part of the setup process.

2. **Using the settings menu**:
   ```bash
   gitmonkey settings ai
   ```

3. **Choose a provider**: Select from OpenAI, Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), or DeepSeek.

4. **Enter your API key**: You can obtain an API key from your chosen provider's website.

## üí° Available AI Features

### 1. AI-Generated Commit Messages
Generate meaningful commit messages based on your changes.

```bash
gitmonkey commit --suggest
```

This will analyze your staged changes and suggest a well-formatted commit message following best practices.

### 2. Smart Branch Naming
Get AI-powered suggestions for branch names based on your recent work.

```bash
gitmonkey branch new --suggest
```

This creates branch name suggestions following conventional naming patterns like feature/, fix/, chore/, etc.

### 3. Merge Risk Analysis
Assess the potential risks before merging branches.

```bash
gitmonkey merge source_branch target_branch --analyze
```

This analyzes both branches and provides:
- A risk assessment score
- Explanation of potential conflicts
- Recommendations to reduce merge risks

### 4. Interactive Git Help
Ask questions about Git in plain language.

```bash
gitmonkey ask "how do I undo my last commit?"
```

This provides contextual Git help with commands you can execute directly.

```bash
gitmonkey settings ai
```

Usage data is stored locally in `~/.gitmonkey/` and never shared externally.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**
   ```
   Error: No API key found for [Provider]
   ```
   Solution: Run `gitmonkey settings ai` and add or update your API key.

2. **Connection Failures**
   ```
   Error: Failed to get response from [Provider]
   ```
   Solutions:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify your API key is valid
   - Try a different AI provider

3. **Usage Limit Reached**
   ```
   Error: Monthly usage limit has been reached.
   ```
   Solution: Increase your usage limit in `gitmonkey settings ai` if desired.

### Performance Tips

- **Use caching**: Git Monkey automatically caches responses for 24 hours
- **Be specific**: More specific prompts produce better results
- **Try different providers**: Each provider has different strengths
