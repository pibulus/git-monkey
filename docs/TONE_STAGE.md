# üêí Git Monkey: Tone Stage & Title Engine System

## Overview

Git Monkey features a unique Tone Stage System that tracks user experience levels over time, and a Title Engine that assigns playful, themed titles based on user progression. This creates an ambient sense of growth and identity without explicit gamification.

## üåÄ Tone Stage System

### What It Does
The Tone Stage System tracks how far along you are in your Git Monkey journey, from absolute beginner to confident Git wizard. This progression affects:

- The tone and verbosity of explanations
- The detail level of help content
- The titles you can earn

### How It Works
- Stages range from 0 (newbie) to 5 (mastery)
- Your stage advances automatically based on your usage patterns:
  - Number of commands used
  - Diversity of commands
  - Tutorial completion
  - Advanced feature usage

### Tone Stage Progression

| Stage | Description | How to Reach This Stage |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 0 | Total beginner | Default for new users |
| 1 | Curious monkey | Use 3+ different commands successfully |
| 2 | Active user | Use branches, stashing, or undo features |
| 3 | Confident explorer | Use worktrees, pivot, or other advanced features |
| 4 | Chillmaster | Use 10+ commands including generate or custom setups |
| 5 | Ascended ape | Complete the tutorial or use 15+ different commands |
