# Git Monkey Svelte Enhancement Roadmap

A step-by-step guide for implementing Svelte-related enhancements while maintaining consistency with Git Monkey's design principles. This roadmap focuses on user experience, terminal efficiency, and educational value.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Modern SvelteKit Foundation (Current Progress)

- [x] Basic Modern SvelteKit setup with server actions

- [ ] Add theme-specific messaging
- [ ] Improve performance visualizations
- [ ] Add ASCII explanations of key concepts

#### Tasks:

1. **Update svelte_modern.sh for full tone-awareness**
   - Add differentiated explanations for all tone stages (0-5)
   - Enhance introduction text based on tone stage
   - Adjust verbosity of success messages
   - Add identity-based messages for lower tone stages

2. **Enhance theme integration**
   - Add theme-specific emojis for modern concepts
   - Create theme-specific analogies for server actions
   - Style success messages according to theme

3. **Improve performance visualization**
   - Add progress indicators for long-running steps
   - Enhance time comparison with GUI alternatives
   - Add visual performance charts using ASCII

4. **Add ASCII diagrams for key concepts**
   - Create diagram for server actions flow
   - Visualize form validation process
   - Illustrate progressive enhancement concept

### Phase 2: Component Library Integration

- [ ] Add Bits UI (shadcn-svelte) setup
- [ ] Improve Skeleton UI integration
- [ ] Create design tokens system
- [ ] Implement theme switching capability

#### Tasks:

1. **Create bits_ui_setup.sh implementation**
   - Follow consistency guidelines for tone and theme
   - Include working examples of common components
   - Add educational elements explaining component architecture

2. **Enhance skeleton_ui_setup.sh**
   - Add more comprehensive component examples
   - Create better integration with data tables
   - Implement form patterns with validation

3. **Create design tokens system**
   - Implement CSS variables for theme customization
   - Add dark/light mode support
   - Create generator for custom theme colors

4. **Add theme switching capability**
   - Create theme switcher component
   - Implement persistence with localStorage
   - Support system preference detection

### Phase 3: Advanced CRUD Capabilities

- [x] Enhance CRUD generator for modern patterns
- [x] Add optimistic UI updates
- [x] Implement real-time data features
- [x] Create filtering and pagination patterns

#### Tasks:

1. **Update crud_generator.sh for modern patterns**
   - [x] Add server action support
   - [x] Implement Zod validation
   - [x] Create type-safe interfaces

2. **Add optimistic UI features**
   - [x] Implement optimistic updates for better UX
   - [x] Add rollback functionality for failed operations
   - [x] Create loading states with skeleton UI

3. **Implement real-time features**
   - [x] Add Supabase realtime subscription support
   - [x] Create WebSocket integration for Node.js
   - [x] Implement polling fallback for static sites

4. **Add filtering and pagination**
   - [x] Create reusable filter components
   - [x] Implement server-side pagination
   - [x] Add sorting capabilities

### Phase 4: Terminal Developer Experience

- [x] Create terminal schema designer
- [ ] Add project insights visualizations
- [ ] Implement comparative metrics dashboards
- [ ] Create animated tutorials for complex concepts

#### Tasks:

1. **Build schema_designer.sh**
   - [x] Create interactive terminal UI for schema design
   - [x] Generate TypeScript types and Zod schemas
   - [x] Add visual feedback for schema relationships

2. **Implement project_insights.sh**
   - Create ASCII visualizations of project structure
   - Add metrics on component usage
   - Visualize dependencies

3. **Create performance_dashboard.sh**
   - Track and visualize command execution times
   - Compare with estimated GUI equivalents
   - Show accumulated time savings

4. **Enhance learn.sh with Svelte content**
   - Create visual tutorials for SvelteKit concepts
   - Add guided walkthroughs for common patterns
   - Implement interactive challenges

## Integration with Existing Features

### Learn Module Integration

For each major feature, create corresponding educational content in learn.sh:

1. **Server Actions Learning Module**
   - Visual explanation of server actions
   - Comparison with client-side approaches
   - Best practices and common patterns

2. **Component Design Learning Module**
   - Component composition patterns
   - State management strategies
   - Accessibility considerations

3. **Data Flow Learning Module**
   - Client/server data flow visualization
   - Form handling patterns
   - Validation strategies

### Consistency Checks

Before moving to each new phase:

1. Run all commands with different tone stages (0-5)
2. Test with all available themes
3. Verify performance tracking is working
4. Ensure error handling is comprehensive
5. Check integration with existing functionality

## Testing Strategy

For each enhancement:

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Does it work as expected?
   - Does it handle edge cases?
   - Does it fail gracefully?

2. **User Experience Testing**
   - Is it consistent with Git Monkey's style?
   - Does it adapt to user's tone stage?
   - Does it provide proper visual feedback?

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Is it faster than GUI alternatives?
   - Does it provide performance metrics?
   - Does it optimize resource usage?

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Does it work with existing features?
   - Does it maintain consistency?
   - Does it leverage shared utilities?
