  echo "   You can work on multiple branches AT THE SAME TIME in different folders."
  echo "   No stashing. No losing your train of thought. No context switching tax."
  echo ""
  
  echo "How it works:"
  echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ Each worktree is a separate directory linked to your main repository"
  echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ Each worktree can be on a different branch"
  echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ Changes in one worktree don't affect others"
  echo "4Ô∏è‚É£ No need to commit or stash before switching contexts"
  echo ""
  
  echo "Example workflow:"
  echo "‚Ä¢ You're working on feature-a in your main repo"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Urgent bug comes in that needs fixing on main branch"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Instead of stashing your changes:"
  echo "  $ gitmonkey worktree:add main"
  echo "  $ gitmonkey worktree:switch main"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Fix the bug in the main worktree, commit and push"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Then easily return to your feature-a work:"
  echo "  $ cd .. && cd your-original-repo"
  echo ""
  
  echo "Git Monkey makes it even easier:"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Use 'gitmonkey pivot <branch>' to automatically stash and switch"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Use 'gitmonkey return' to go back and restore your work"

  echo "Try it yourself:"
  echo "  gitmonkey worktree:add my-feature    # Create a worktree"
  echo "  gitmonkey worktree:switch my-feature # Switch to it"
  echo "  gitmonkey worktree:list              # See all worktrees"
  echo ""
  
  echo "Advanced worktree techniques:"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Keep a worktree for each active feature/bug you're working on"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Use worktrees for code reviews without disrupting your work"

  echo "The Problem:"
  echo "When you create a new branch and try to push for the first time,"
  echo "Git requires you to set an upstream branch with this verbose command:"
  echo "  git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name"
  echo ""
  
  echo "Git Monkey's Solution:"
  echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ Just use 'gitmonkey push' for any branch"
  echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ If no upstream exists, it's automatically set up for you"
  echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ First-time push? No problem! Git Monkey handles the details"
  echo ""
  
  echo "Even Better:"
  echo "Git Monkey can configure Git to always set upstream automatically"
  echo "with a simple one-time setting: push.autoSetupRemote"

  echo "  gitmonkey push             # Smart push with auto-upstream setup"
  echo "  gitmonkey push --force     # Force push with auto-upstream if needed"
  echo "  gitmonkey push --no-config # Don't offer to configure global setting"

  echo "Pro tip:"
  echo "After using 'gitmonkey push' once on a branch, future pushes"
