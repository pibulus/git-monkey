## üåà Design Philosophy

Git Monkey is powered by the Soft Stack:

- **Emotional intelligence** - We know Git can be scary
- **Delightful UX** - Terminal joy should be standard
- **Slack for chaos** - Git mistakes happen to everyone
- **Hacker joy, human ease** - Power without the pain

We believe learning should feel fun, not fragile.

## üöÄ Project Starter

Git Monkey includes a powerful project starter that helps you scaffold new projects with your preferred tech stack:

```bash
gitmonkey start my-awesome-project
```

The starter wizard guides you through:

- **Frameworks**: SvelteKit, Node.js, or static sites
- **UI Libraries**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI
- **Backend Services**: Supabase integration
- **Developer Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, GitHub repo setup

You can save your favorite configurations as presets:

```bash
# Use a saved preset
gitmonkey start new-project --preset favorite

# Skip prompts and use defaults
gitmonkey start quick-project --minimal
```
