# 🐒 Git Monkey CLI

**The chillest, kindest way to learn Git.**  
Built for curious humans, not grumpy devs.  
Inspired by retro hacker energy and the joy of getting unstuck.

## 🌈 Design Philosophy

Git Monkey is powered by the Soft Stack:

- **Emotional intelligence** - We know Git can be scary
- **Delightful UX** - Terminal joy should be standard
- **Slack for chaos** - Git mistakes happen to everyone
- **Hacker joy, human ease** - Power without the pain

We believe learning should feel fun, not fragile.
